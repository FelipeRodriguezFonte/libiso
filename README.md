# Paysim
An open ISO8583 Simulator

<ul>
<li>The application is built using go and GTK+2 bindings made available at github.com/mattn/go-gtk (Thanks a ton Yashuhiro Matsumoto!)</li>
<li>The entire source code is available at https://github.com/rkbalgi/go</li>
<li>The interesting packages would be github.com/rkbalgi/go/execs/paysim, github.com/rkbalgi/go/paysim and github.com/rkbalgi/iso8583</li>
<li>There are loads of other interesting things available in other packages â€“ like a minimalist implementation of a Thales HSM for basic commands (A6, MS, M6 and the like)
</li>
</ul>
